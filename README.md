# ctac-bot

### Developer Workflow

The `ctac-bot` source repository has two permanent branches: `main` and `dev`.  **All development must occur either in branch `dev`, or (preferably) in feature branches off of `dev`.**  All PRs must also be submitted against `dev`; the `main` branch is **only** updated from `dev` via PRs created by the core development team.  All other changes submitted to `main` will be rejected.

This model allows otherwise unrelated changes to be batched up in the `dev` branch, integration tested there, and then released en masse to the `main` branch.  The `main` branch is configured to auto-deploy to a production environment, and therefore that branch must only contain tested, functioning code.
